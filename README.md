## General Information
- Objective:
- The goal is to decrease credit loss by employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to identify the primary factors contributing to loan default.

- Background:
- The company serves as the premier online loan marketplace, offering personal, business, and medical procedure financing. We prioritize user accessibility and efficiency, providing borrowers with swift access to low-interest loans via our streamlined online platform. However, like many lending institutions, our greatest financial risk stems from lending to applicants deemed 'risky,' as these individuals are most likely to default on their loans, resulting in significant credit loss.

- Approach:
- To mitigate credit loss, we will conduct EDA to uncover the key drivers behind loan defaults. By analyzing various data points and patterns within our borrower profiles, we aim to identify factors strongly correlated with default behavior. This analysis will guide our strategic decisions in risk assessment, enabling us to refine our lending practices and minimize exposure to default risk.

## Conclusions
Overall, the analysis suggests several key factors that significantly influence the probability of loan default. These factors include the purpose of the loan, income level, interest rates, loan amount, borrower's employment length, verification status, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), loan grade, property ownership status, geographical location, bankruptcy history, and time of loan approval.
